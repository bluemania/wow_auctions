# Release

Releases are to be carried out from the master branch with a tagged commit.
We have Github actions which will:

- Run all tests
- Publish codebase to pypi
- Publish documentation to readthedocs
- Update the README badges

The process for performing a release is as follows:

- [] Merge all feature branches into dev branch
- [] On local dev branch, increment the project version with `poetry version {major|minor|patch}`
- [] Ensure the project README is current
- [] Commit changes, and use `git tag` to tag the comment using the same version as per poetry
- [] Push to Github using `git push origin master --tags`
- [] Raise a pull request for `dev -> master`
- [] Draft new release, referencing the latest tag
