   Pricer performs data analysis on the WoW auction house.

   Pricer uses WoW addon data to analyze optimal policies for
   auction buying and selling. This can help users to earn more gold per hour
   spent in game.
   Project is under development, moving from a prototype towards open-source
   standard software.
   I am looking to implement best practices throughout development.
   When the codebase is considered stable, we will be moving towards more
   data science approaches to experimentation and analysis.
